# **Databricks Setup and Configuration**

# **Introduction to Databricks**
Databricks is a data analytics platform built on top of Apache Spark. It provides a managed environment for data engineering, data science, and large-scale data analytics.

# **Apache Spark and Its Ecosystem**
Apache Spark is an open-source distributed data processing engine offering:
- **High Performance**: In-memory data processing
- **Versatility**: Supports multiple programming languages:
  - **PySpark**: Python interface for Spark
  - **Spark SQL**: Structured data processing with SQL
  - **Scala**: Spark's native language
  - **SparkR**: R interface for Spark

#  **Databricks Community Edition**
- Free version for learning and experimentation
- 14-day trial period
- Limited features but sufficient for basic data processing
- Perfect for proof of concept and learning

# **Databricks Workspace Setup**
## **Creating Compute**
1. Navigate to "Compute" tab
2. Click "Create Compute"
3. Basic configuration:
   - Choose cluster type: Single Node
   - Runtime version: Select latest stable version
   - Node type: Smallest available (for Community Edition)

## **Compute Limitations**
**Important**: Databricks Community Edition has several limitations:
- **Auto-termination**: Compute will shut down after inactive period
- **Restart Required**: After termination, compute cannot be restarted
- **Solutions**:
  - Create new compute when needed
  - Save compute configuration for quick setup/clone compute
  - Plan work to be efficient in one session
  - Ensure regular saving of notebooks and code

# **Creating a Notebook**
1. Click "Workspace" in sidebar
2. Select "Create" > "Notebook"
3. Configure notebook:
   - Name the notebook
   - Choose default language: Python
   - Select created cluster

# **Workspace Environment**
Databricks Notebook provides:
- Interactive coding interface
- Built-in data visualization
- Spark integration
- Collaborative features
- Version control
- Markdown support for documentation

# **Best Practices**
1. **Resource Management**:
   - Monitor compute usage
   - Save work frequently
   - Detach notebook from compute when not in use

2. **Development Flow**:
   - Use cell-based development
   - Test code on small datasets first
   - Utilize Markdown for documentation

3. **Data Integration**:
   - Set up AWS S3 connection early
   - Verify data access before processing
   - Use temporary views for exploratory analysis

# **Next Steps**
With Databricks workspace ready, we will proceed to:
1. Integrate with AWS S3
2. Read and analyze data using PySpark
3. Perform data transformation and visualization
